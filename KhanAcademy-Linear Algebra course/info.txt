Here are some code samples of Khan Academy Linear Algebra course.
I decided to take a small pause from 3blue1brown last videos (from linear algebra course) as they are kinda complicated.
So now I want to walk through linear algebra and later see some intuitions and insides of it.

Thanks for Khan Academy for this free course!
