# Samplings 08.04.24
Today I'm studying Samplings 08.04.24:
Class: Intro To Statistics (Russian language)
Course:  [link](https://stepik.org/course/76)
Progress: I'm interested

Notes:

Population (Рус. Генеральная совокупность) - all subjects we're exploring.
For example in case of research on the most favourite toon character for children from age of 10 to the age of 12 our population will be all children with age 10-12.

But we can not ask every kiddo about his favourite toon character, so we need to form <u>sample</u>.
We need to form a _representative_ sample (meaning information and hypothesis from this sample can be extrapolated on our population with minimum loss of information)

There are few main ways to form sample:

1. Random Sample (easiest, but least efficient)
We pick random subjects from our population.

It's easy, but inefficient.

2. Stratified Sample. (better)

We divide our subjects to groups by some parameters and characteristics: (gender, age, favourite pokemon etc.) and then randomly pick subjects from these strats.
Such sampling is really useful, as our research will be better.

3. Cluster Sample.

It's really simmilar to Stratified Sample, but here we take some really similar groups (clusters), randomly pick few of those clusters, and randomly pick subjects from these (randomly picked) clusters.

Excercise:

Match the methods of forming a choice with the examples provided.

A. In order to test the course on manual statistics and find out whether the students of the Bioinformatics Institute would cope well with it, 50 students of the institute were thus randomly selected.

B. To study the relationship between the risk of developing the disease and human blood groups, study participants were divided into four groups (according to the division of blood). Then, 50 people were randomly selected from each group.

C. To test the mathematics knowledge of St. Petersburg schoolchildren, a study was organized. 10 schools were randomly selected and then 50 students from different classes were randomly selected from each school.

A - random sample
B - stratified sample
C - cluster sample

# Variables

We form our samples to explore some information about our population.
Our samples contain some values (variables):

There are 2 main types of variables:
1. Quantitive
This variable type is used to describe some numeric parameters (Age, Height, Favourite number etc.)

Quantitive variables are also divided on 2 types:
	1.1 Continuous - This type incluedes all values in some segment.
	1.2 Discrete - This type includes value in some segment with restrictions (Only int values etc.)
		(For example - quantity of Mr. Robot fans - (it can not be float, as we count people with int))

2. Nominative
This variable type is used as a label (for example sex of a person):
1 - Female
0 - Male
etc.
We can not compare such variables.

3. Rank variables (They are strange here)

They can be compared, but they have pretty same idea as nominative ones and they can be compared with some restrictions.

For example:

Position of sportsman in run.
We can set some kind of label on every sportsman - his position.
It seems like it's nominative variable, but wait.
We can definetly say that sportsman, who finished 1st is faster than sportsman who finished last.
We can compare such variables, but we can not measure it.
Like we can not say - how faster 1st sportman is than last sportsman.
