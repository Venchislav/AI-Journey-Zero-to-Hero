# Central Limit Theorem of Means.

Suppose we have some normal distribution.
Let's form some samples of this distribution.

Of course our samples will have different $\overline x$ from $\mu$ of our population.
But if we take mean of each sample and form distribution of this samples we will find out that this distribution is not only normal, but mean of this distribution will be equal (really close to) mean of our population.

If we increase amount of values in sample our accuracy will increase -> Our means distribution will be thinner.

By the way we call sd of such distribution as a <u>Standard Error</u>.
We calculate it in such way:

$$se = {\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}$$

Here it's pretty wrong thing (it will be discussed later), but here's formula for sample:

$$se = {sd \over \sqrt{n}}$$
It's cool, as we can extropolate our results on our population!

That's it with this e note for now.
I wrote down more things in my notebook (sadly I can't share it here)

C ya!
