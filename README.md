# AI-Journey-Zero-to-Hero
This is a repository for my Data Science Journey Showcase
___
Welcome! <br>
This is my AI journey. Recently I realised that my knowledge is not deep enough and sometimes some nets are black boxes for me. <br>
Sometimes I had troubles with model optimization and tuning. But now I want to fix it.
___
The idea to improve my knowledge from basics came to me after fail of Painting Generation on ConvMoNET (GEN-1 model) <br>
I spent all week on tuning, training again and again this model, but nothing helped. <br>
Then I thought if I don't have enough knowledge (don't know some key secret that will help me) <br>
So now, I want to become cool Data Scientis with all knowledge needed. <br
___
This repository will contain directories from different courses and lectures. I will be writing different code (even on stats, linear algebra and other) <br>
I hope this repository will be helpfull and clear for newbies to start their journey.<br>

After all... I'm glad that GEN-1 failed (for now). <br>
Now I have motivation, resources, and all to become good Data Scientist <br>
This program is pretty hard (it's maybe around 500 hours+ with practice) but I'll try my best to become better!
___
I need to take 1 day break, as now I have to spend a day working on secret project <br>
Later this text will be deleted
